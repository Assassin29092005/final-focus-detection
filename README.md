# 🎯 Real-Time AI Exam Proctoring System

> An advanced, real-time AI-powered proctoring system that monitors a candidate during an online exam using their webcam.  
> It detects distractions, unauthorized persons, and phone usage — all processed locally with no cloud dependency.

## 🚀 Features

✅ **Dynamic Face Registration** – Securely registers the user at the start of the test using the first frame from their webcam.  
✅ **Real-Time Attention Score** – Calculates a "Focus Score" (0–100) based on face presence, head pose, and gaze.  
✅ **Phone Detection** – Uses **YOLOv8** to detect mobile phones or other electronic devices in real-time.  
✅ **Multi-Face Detection** – Detects if more than one person appears in the frame.  
✅ **Unauthorized Person Alert** – Verifies that the face in the frame matches the registered user’s embedding.  
✅ **Distraction Alerts** – Issues "Looking Away" alerts if focus drops below a threshold (default: 40%).  
✅ **Smart Cooldowns** – Prevents alert spam with a 5-second cooldown per alert type.  
✅ **Warning Limit System** – Automatically ends the test after 5 critical alerts.  
✅ **Efficient Performance** – Optimized for CPU, alternating between face and phone detection for real-time response.  
✅ **Pure WebSocket Backend** – Ultra-fast communication via Python’s lightweight `websockets` library.

## ▶️ How to Run

### 🧩 Step 1: Run the Backend Server
Start the WebSocket backend:
```bash
python socket.py
```

Expected output:
```
Loading InsightFace model (buffalo_s)...
InsightFace model loaded.
Loading PhoneDetector model (yolov8n.pt)...
PhoneDetector model loaded.
Starting WebSocket server on ws://0.0.0.0:8765...
```

Keep this terminal **running** during the test.

### 🌐 Step 2: Run the Frontend
Open **`index.html`** in your browser (double-click it or drag it into a new tab).

Allow camera access when prompted.

---

### 🧾 Step 3: Start the Test
1. Click **“Start Session”**  
2. The system registers your face and begins monitoring.  
3. You’ll see:
   - **AUTHORIZED** message  
   - **Live Focus Score** updates  
4. Click **“End Test”** to gracefully stop the session.

## 🧩 Example Alerts

| Alert Type          | Trigger Condition                       | Action |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------|--------|
| `LOOKING_AWAY`      | Focus score < 40                         | Warning |
| `PHONE_DETECTED`    | Phone found in frame                     | Critical |
| `MULTIPLE_FACES`    | More than one person detected            | Critical |
| `UNAUTHORIZED_USER` | Face mismatch with registered embedding  | Critical |

---

## ⚡ Performance Highlights
- Optimized for real-time CPU inference  
- Alternates between face and phone detection for efficiency  
- Uses exponential moving average (EMA) for stable focus scoring  
- Smart cooldowns prevent repetitive alert flooding
